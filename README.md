# Svelte Simple Startet Kit

This starter kit aims at fast, simple and clean builds for small projects.

It features:

- **Svelte** for components;
- **SASS** as CSS preprocessor;
- **roadtrip** as routing tool;
- **Rollup** as bundler/task-runner;
- **Buble** as ES6/7+ transpiler.

This development stack leads to fast builds and small code footprint for production.

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
